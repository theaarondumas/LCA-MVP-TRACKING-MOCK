# LightsCameraAction (LCA) – MVP Audition Tracker Mock

This repository is a front-end clickable prototype of the **Audition Transparency System** for the LightsCameraAction (LCA) platform.

It shows how an actor can track an audition like an Amazon package, with clearly defined steps and a cinematic, mobile-first UI.

## 🎬 Core Flow

The mock implements the core audition journey:

1. **Submitted** – tape uploaded
2. **Delivered to Casting** – casting can access the audition
3. **Viewed** – first watch logged
4. **Viewed Again** – repeat watches (strong interest)
5. **Shortlisted** – actor is officially in the mix
6. **Callback Pending** – casting is deciding on callbacks

You can:
- Use **Next/Back** to step manually through the pipeline
- Use **Play Flow** to animate the progression as if casting is updating in real time

## 🛠 Tech

Pure front-end:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No build tools needed.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Click **Play Flow** to see the tracking system animate.

## 🌱 Intended Use

- Product vision decks
- Developer handoff
