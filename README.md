# LightsCameraAction (LCA) – Live MVP Audition Tracker Demo

This version of the prototype is built specifically for **live investor and partner demos**.

- The **Actor View** shows how an actor experiences their audition as a clear, cinematic status journey.
- The **Casting View** shows how simple it is for casting to update that journey in real time.

## 🎬 What the Demo Does

When the page loads:

1. The demo automatically plays through the full audition lifecycle:
   - Submitted  
   - Delivered to Casting  
   - Viewed  
   - Viewed Again  
   - Shortlisted  
   - Callback Pending  

2. The **Actor View** highlights each step like an Amazon-style tracking flow.

3. The **Casting View**:
   - Highlights the corresponding status pill
   - Shows a short narrative of what just happened in the workflow

You can also interrupt the auto-demo at any time by clicking a status pill on the casting side to show manual updates.

## 🛠 Tech

Still pure front-end:

- HTML (`index.html`)
- CSS (`styles.css`)
- Vanilla JavaScript (`app.js`)

No backend, no build tooling required.  
Perfect for GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel or any static hosting.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Deploy this folder to a static host (or replace the previous prototype files in your repo).
2. Open the live URL.
3. Press **Restart Demo** in front of investors, casting partners, or potential cofounders to walk them through the audition journey.

This is intended as a **visual and experiential pitch artifact**, not production code.
